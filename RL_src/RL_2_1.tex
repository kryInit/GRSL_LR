\begin{point}
	The introduction lacks a clear differentiation between the proposed method and existing TV-regularized FWI approaches, particularly those based on splitting techniques. The authors should explicitly state how their method improves upon prior work (or its connections), such as ADMM-based, split Bregman, FISTA, and proximal Newton approaches.
