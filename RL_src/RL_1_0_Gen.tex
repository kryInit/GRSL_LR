	This paper presents an implementation of TV regularization for solving the FWI problem using the classical reduced-space formulation with an L2-norm misfit function. The author introduces the primal-dual splitting method with proximal operators to eliminate the inner loop required for nonlinear TV mapping. While the proposed algorithm may be useful for certain inverse problems, I find it unsuitable for FWI due to the following reasons:
