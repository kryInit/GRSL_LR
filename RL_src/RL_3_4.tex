\begin{point}
	The use of a box constraint to keep velocity values within [l, u] is common; however, further discussion of the physical implications of the TV constraint would enhance the paper. For instance, how does enforcing TV relate to known geological structures or stratigraphic features? Can you provide examples or discuss cases where the TV constraint may excessively smooth features that are important for interpretation?
