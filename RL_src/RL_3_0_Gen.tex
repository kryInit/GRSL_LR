	The manuscript presents a novel algorithm for full-waveform inversion (FWI) that incorporates a Total Variation (TV) constraint into the inversion process via a primal-dual splitting (PDS) method. The goal is to improve both the computational efficiency and the accuracy of subsurface reconstructions. Overall, the paper addresses an important challenge in seismic imaging, and the proposed method is of potential interest to the geophysical community. However, several aspects require further clarification and refinement before publication. I therefore recommend major revisions.
