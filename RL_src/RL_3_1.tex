	While the approach is innovative, the manuscript would benefit from a more explicit comparison with existing TV-constrained FWI methods (e.g., references [21–24]). It is not entirely clear how the proposed formulation and algorithm differ from these earlier approaches beyond the elimination of inner loops. A discussion emphasizing the advantages—both theoretical and practical—would help contextualize your contribution.
