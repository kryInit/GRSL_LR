	The proposed method is based on the reduced-space approach, which is known to be highly sensitive to cycle-skipping. Over the past decade, extensive research has demonstrated the advantages of extended-source FWI using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which enables TV regularization to be applied efficiently without inner loops. The paper does not adequately compare or contrast the proposed approach with these state-of-the-art methods.
