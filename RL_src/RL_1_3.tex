	The numerical example provided is not representative of realistic FWI case. The problem is formulated on a small subset of a benchmark model, placing the inverse problem in a linear regime. Furthermore, as observed in Figure 5, the method requires 5000 iterations, which is highly impractical and significantly deviates from the efficiency of modern FWI algorithms.
