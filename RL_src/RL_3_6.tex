	The figures depicting velocity models (Figs. 3 and 4) are central to evaluating the performance. To improve these figures, please provide individual color bars for each figure and discuss in more detail the “wave-like artifacts” observed in standard FWI and how the TV constraint mitigates these artifacts. Additionally, please provide a more detailed discussion of the “point artifacts” near the surface, which appear similar to source-receiver artifacts; note that the number of these artifacts (four in Fig. 3a) is much smaller than the number of sources (20) or receivers (101). Finally, please change the labeling in Fig. 4 from (e–h) to (a–d), as Figs. 3 and 4 are two separate figures, not one combined figure.
