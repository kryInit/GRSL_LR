\begin{point}
	The selection of the TV bound parameter $\alpha$ (ranging from 100 to 700) and the step sizes ($\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$) is not sufficiently justified. Given that FWI is highly sensitive to such hyperparameters, it would be beneficial to include a discussion on how these parameters could be selected in practice, possibly through data-driven approaches or based on prior geological knowledge.
